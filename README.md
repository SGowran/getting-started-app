# Getting started

App Updates:

♡ Changed background, it’s pink with sparkles and contains a motivational bunny for support

♡ Functionally added a share list option – the way to get tasks done is to be held socially accountable, so being able to share the list would help communicate to friend/partner/teammate what needs to be done.

♡ The appearance of the share button matches the colour scheme of the new background. 
It also has a paper airplane icon to make it more intuitive and user friendly. 

♡ Title Change

♡ The no tasks yet message change

♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡
